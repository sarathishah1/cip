# The Life Expectancy Project

A web app to calculate your life expectancy based on socioeconomic factors affecting people in the EU (except for Xipre)

App currently running on [Render](https://render.com).

The app in this repo is deployed at the following [link](https://flask-hello-world-eeib.onrender.com).

Feel free to extend our research further as time goes! If you are interested in the project we recommend you take a look at the jupyter notebooks and take advantage of our work for anything it may help you with.

This project was made for a subject at University called Proyecto I. 

The little time we had to do the research, analysis and regression models led to us not being able to make the app take new up-to-date data by itself, as you can see in the unfinished GeneralDataWebScraper file.

Making use of Jupyter Notebooks, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript we managed to set up what we can only consider a success as a project and as a learning experience.

Exploring Sci-Kit Learn and XGBoost libraries to make an acurate prediction each time depending on the factors taken into account was an interesting experience and a real challenge that boosted our skills through the roof opening our sights to new horizons and project ideas.

### Disclaimer

The web app takes up to 3 minutes to load if no one has used it for the last 15 minutes or so as it's being hosted on a free Render account with limited resources.

The project was made by me and 4 other students: [Isabelle](https://github.com/ArcherIsa), [Carla](https://github.com/caarlaaj), [Fernanda](https://github.com/Fdepaulaneves), [Michele](https://github.com/Miicchh) at UPV in spanish, so some files may have text in spanish.
